When an application defines a resource type or location based on user input, such as a file name or port number, this data can be manipulated to execute or access different resources.

      - use
      - require

    name: SQL Injection
    message: A SQL injection attack consists of insertion or “injection” of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system and in some cases issue commands to the operating system.
    sample:
      - prepare
      - execute
      - bind_param
      - do
      - find
      - create
      - update
      - ora_open
      - ora_do
      - ora_fetch
