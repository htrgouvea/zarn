    name: Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
    message: Occur when untrusted data is rendered as HTML without proper escaping, allowing attackers to execute malicious scripts in the context of the victim's browser.
    sample:
      - render

    name: Command Injection
    message: Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data like form values, cookies, HTTP headers etc. to a system shell. In this attack, the attacker-supplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application.
    sample:
      - exec
      - syscall
      - open
      - qx
      - readpipe
  - id: '0006'
    category: vuln
    name: Connection String Injection
    message: A connection string injection attack can occur when dynamic string concatenation is used to build connection strings that are based on user input. If the string isn't validated and malicious text or characters not escaped, an attacker can potentially access sensitive data or other resources on the server.
    sample:
      - connect
      - ora_login
  - id: '0007'
    category: vuln
    name: LDAP Injection
    message: LDAP Injection is an attack used to exploit web based applications that construct LDAP statements based on user input. When an application fails to properly sanitize user input, it's possible to modify LDAP statements using a local proxy. This could result in the execution of arbitrary commands such as granting permissions to unauthorized queries, and content modification inside the LDAP tree.
    sample:
      - search
      - modify
      - moddn
      - add
      - bind
      - delete
      - compare

    name: XSS
    message: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user.
    sample:
      - print
      - printf
      - say
      - echo
      - header
      - start_html
      - end_html

    category: vuln
    name: Remote File Inclusion
    message: This vulnerability allows an attacker to include a file, usually exploiting a "dynamic file inclusion" mechanisms implemented in the target application. The vulnerability occurs due to the use of user-supplied input without proper validation. this can lead to issues like - Code execution, Denial of Service, Sensitive Information Disclosure,etc.
    sample:
      - use
      - require
  - id: '0010'
    category: vuln
    name: Resource Injection
    message: This attack consists of changing resource identifiers used by an application in order to perform a malicious task. When an application defines a resource type or location based on user input, such as a file name or port number, this data can be manipulated to execute or access different resources.
    sample:
      - socket
  - id: '0011'
    category: vuln
    name: SQL Injection
    message: A SQL injection attack consists of insertion or “injection” of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system and in some cases issue commands to the operating system.
    sample:
      - prepare
      - execute
      - bind_param
      - do
      - find
      - create
      - update
      - ora_open
      - ora_do
      - ora_fetch
      - select
      - query
